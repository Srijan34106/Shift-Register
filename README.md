# Shift-Register

What is a Shift Register?
-> A shift register is a digital circuit that is used to store and manipulate data by shifting it in a specific direction, either left or right. It consists of a series of flip-flops, each storing one bit of data, connected in a chain.

Which Shift register is used?
-> 74HC595 (8-bit storage and 8-bit register).

In this project, the 8051 microcontroller is interfaced with a shift register(74HC595). This simulation is performed in proteus simulator and the code is written in the c language through the keil Uvision5 software.
